# Predicting Paper Breaks in Industrial Process with SVM

Applied classification techniques to predict paper breaks in an imbalanced dataset from a manufacturing process.

## Highlights
- Used logistic regression and tuned SVM with RBF kernel
- Tuned C, sigma, and threshold tau using ROC, PR, and F1 analysis
- Achieved 75% sensitivity and 91% specificity

## Tools & Libraries
- R, `kernlab`, `ROCR`, `caret`, cross-validation, performance metrics, etc.

## Structure
- `paper_breaks_svm.qmd` – Model training and evaluation
- `paper_breaks_svm.pdf` – Rendered report
- `data_processminer.RData` – Data
